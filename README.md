# üöÄ Usage

This software automatically fixes some errors and warnings reported by
`yamllint`.

```shell
usage: yamlfixer [-h] [-v] [-b] [-B BACKUPSUFFIX] [-d] [-D DIFF_FILE] [-e EXTENSIONS] [-f]
                 [-F] [-l] [-N] [-n] [-r LEVEL] [-j | -p | -s] [-t TABSIZE]
                 [-c CONFIG_FILE | -C CONFIG_DATA]
                 [FILE_or_DIR [FILE_or_DIR ...]]

Fix formatting problems in YAML documents. If no file is specified, then reads input from `stdin`.

positional arguments:
  FILE_or_DIR           the YAML files to fix. Use `-` to read from `stdin`.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         display this program's version number and exit.
  -b, --backup          make a backup copy of original files.
  -B BACKUPSUFFIX, --backupsuffix BACKUPSUFFIX
                        sets the suffix for backup files, `.orig` is the default.
  -d, --debug           output debug information to stderr.
  -D DIFF_FILE, --diffto DIFF_FILE
                        name of the file a unified diff will be written to.
                        Defaults to `/dev/null`.
  -e EXTENSIONS, --ext EXTENSIONS
                        comma separated list of acceptable extensions when searching directories
                        for YAML files. Defaults to `yaml,yml,yamllint`.
  -f, --forcecolors     force colorized output even if stream is not a TTY.
  -F, --followsymlinks  follow symbolic links when recursing directories.
  -l, --listfixers      output the list of available fixers.
  -N, --nosyntax        don't try to fix syntax errors.
  -n, --nochange        don't modify anything.
  -r LEVEL, --recurse LEVEL
                        sets the maximum recursion level for directories. Default is `0` meaning
                        no recursion, and any negative value means no limit.
  -j, --jsonsummary     output JSON summary to stderr.
  -p, --plainsummary    output plain text summary to stderr.
  -s, --summary         output colorized plain text summary to stderr. If stderr is not a TTY
                        output is identical to --plainsummary unless --forcecolors is also used.
  -t TABSIZE, --tabsize TABSIZE
                        sets the number of spaces to replace tabs with, default is `2`.
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                        path to yamllint's custom configuration file, none by default.
  -C CONFIG_DATA, --config-data CONFIG_DATA
                        custom configuration for yamllint as YAML source, none by default.
```

yamlfixer launches `yamllint` on each specified filename, then parses
its output and tries to fix the reported problems. The special
filename `-` means `stdin`, and is assumed if there's no other
filename argument.

If input is read from `stdin`, the corrected output will be sent to
`stdout`.

Other files will be overwritten if needed. Original files, `stdin`
excepted, can be preserved as `.orig` if the `--backup` command line
option is used. You can specify any other backup filename suffix with
the `--backupsuffix` command line option.

Both summaries and diagnostic information are sent to stderr.

This command exits with status `2` if there are incompatible command
line options. It exits with `-2` if yamllint is not available on your
system. Otherwise it exits with `0` if all input files either are
skipped, entirely fixed, or already successfully passed `yamllint`
strict mode before, else `-1`.

For convenience, all or parts of the command line arguments can be
read from a file, one per line, by using the well known `@argsfile`
syntax. For example you could do something like this :

```shell
$ find . -type f -name "*.yml" >list-of-yaml-files
$ yamlfixer --nochange --summary @list-of-yaml-files
```

Although this could probably be shortened to :

```shell
$ yamlfixer --nochange --summary --recurse -1 .
```

**IMPORTANT:** Not all problems are fixable by `yamlfixer`. Due to the
fact that `yamllint` doesn't currently report all faulty lines,
`yamlfixer` might even introduce indentation problems under some
circumstances.

# GitHub Action

You can now use this software as a GitHub Action, available from https://github.com/opt-nc/yamlfixer-action .
This GitHub Action will automatically create Pull Requests to your repository with the changes made by yamlfixer.

# Fixers

yamlfixer currently (as of 0.6.4) can fix the following problems as reported by `yamllint` :

  - comment not indented like content (comments-indentation)
  - line too long
  - missing document start
  - missing starting space in comment (comments)
  - no new line character at the end of file
  - syntax error: expected `'<document start>'`, but found `'<stream end>'` (syntax)
  - syntax error: expected `<block end>`, but found `'<block mapping start>'`
  - syntax error: expected `<block end>`, but found `'<block sequence start>'` (syntax)
  - syntax error: expected `<block end>`, but found `'?'`
  - syntax error: found character '\t' that cannot start any token (syntax)
  - syntax error: mapping values are not allowed here
  - too few spaces after comma (commas)
  - too few spaces before comment (comments)
  - too many blank lines
  - too many spaces after colon (colons)
  - too many spaces after comma (commas)
  - too many spaces after hyphen (hyphens)
  - too many spaces before colon (colons)
  - too many spaces before comma (commas)
  - too many spaces inside braces (braces)
  - too many spaces inside brackets (brackets)
  - too many spaces inside empty brackets (brackets)
  - trailing spaces (trailing-spaces)
  - truthy value should be one of [false, true] (truthy)
  - wrong indentation: expected

An always up-to-date list of fixers can be obtained with `yamlfixer --listfixers`.

**IMPORTANT : fixing syntax errors is done on a best effort basis and
may work only partially or not at all for you. Use the -N|--nosyntax
command line switch do prevent `yamlfixer` from trying to fix syntax
errors.**

# üí™ Tips and tricks

Find here a set of tips & tricks about how to achieve great things.

Don't find the usecase you're looking for ‚û°Ô∏è [üé´ Fill a dedicated issue so we could share your idea with the comunity](https://github.com/opt-nc/yamlfixer/issues/new?assignees=&labels=help+wanted&template=ask-for-command-line-script---.md&title=Request+for+script+or+oneLiner)

## ‚è© One liners

Most of us love short and efficient command lines. Here are some ready to use ones : 

### Piping `json` summary through `jq`

```
yamlfixer --jsonsummary examples/good.yml 2>&1 | jq
```

So you can get a nicely colorized (and validated `json` output) : 

```json
{
  "filestofix": 1,
  "passed": 1,
  "modified": 0,
  "fixed": 0,
  "skipped": 0,
  "notwritable": 0,
  "unknown": 0,
  "nochangemode": false,
  "details": {
    "examples/good.yml": {
      "numericstatus": 0,
      "status": "PASSED",
      "issues": 0,
      "handled": 0
    }
  }
}
```

### Check if `yamlfixer` could fix a `yaml` and get the exit code

See how to produce a patch file without modifying the original one,
and get the exit code so you can go further in automation :

```shell
$ yamlfixer --nochange --summary --diffto my.patch examples/bad.yml
Files to fix: 1
0 files were already correct before
0 files were modified but problems remain
1 files were entirely fixed
0 files were skipped
0 files were not writable
0 files with unknown status
      FIXED examples/bad.yml (handled 4/4)
WARNING: No file was modified per user's request !

$ echo $?
0

$ cat my.patch
diff -u "examples/bad.yml" "examples/bad.yml-after"
--- "examples/bad.yml"
+++ "examples/bad.yml-after"
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
-

       - name: Build with Maven
-          run: mvn package
-
-
+        run: mvn package
$ 
```

You can then manually apply the patch file to modify `examples/bad.yml` if
that's what you want to do :

```shell
$ patch -p0 <my.patch
patching file examples/bad.yml
$
```

But of course, it would have been simpler to not use the `--nochange`
command line option in the first place, so that the file would have
been fixed automatically.
