# yamlfixer
yamlfixer automates the fixing of problems reported by
[yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) by parsing its
output.

# Prerequisites
In order for it to work, _yamlfixer_ needs that the following
utilities are already installed on your system, in a directory present
in your _$PATH_ :

- _Python_ v3.6 or higher
- _yamllint_ v1.26.3 or higher

Then simply copy the _yamlfixer_ file to a directory present in your
_$PATH_, and ensure it is executable, for example:

```
cp yamlfixer /usr/local/bin
chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/yamlfixer
```

# Usage
This software automatically fixes some errors and warnings reported by
_yamllint_.

usage:

```
$ yamlfixer [--debug] [--verbose] [--backup] *.yml - thisfile.yaml
```

or:

```
$ yamlfixer [--help] [--version]
```

This will launch _yamllint_ on each specified file name (`-` is _stdin_),
then parse its output and try to fix the reported problems.

If input is read from _stdin_, the corrected output will be sent to
_stdout_. Other files will be overwritten if needed. Original files,
_stdin_ excepted, can be preserved as _.orig_ if the _--backup_
command line option is used.

Diagnostic information is sent to stderr in verbose or debug modes.

This command exits with `0` if all input files either are skipped or
successfully pass _yamllint_ strict mode, else `-1`.

**IMPORTANT:** Not all problems are fixable by _yamlfixer_. Due to the
way _yamllint_ works, it doesn't currenlty report all faulty lines,
_yamlfixer_ might even introduce indentation problems under some
circumstances.
**Use at your own risk, you have been warned...**
